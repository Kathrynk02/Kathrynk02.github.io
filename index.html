            <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
            <p><h3>Challenge Child Abuse is trying to end and prevent child abuse. We have created a device called "ECA" that will allow <br> children to communicate with someone from our headquarters. The ECA has two buttons. When the ECA <br> turns on it will ask you how you are feeling today. Then you can respond by pressing button a for a smiley face<br> or button b for a frowny face. If you have an emergency you press a then b then both at the same time to send an emergency <br> call to headquarters. Finally headquarters will respond by telling you help is on the way.</h3></p>
