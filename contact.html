<h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
<p>Challenge Child Abuse is trying to end and prevent child abuse. We have created a device that will allow <br> children to communicate with someone from our headquarters. The device has two buttons. When the device <br> turns on it will ask you how you are feeling today. Then you can respond by pressing button a for a smiley face<br> or button b for a frowny face. If you have an emergency you press a then b then both at the same time to send an emergency <br> call to headquarters. Finally headquarters will respond by telling you help is on the way.</p>
