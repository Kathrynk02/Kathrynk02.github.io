    <p><h3>Verbal abuse is any behavior or language which is aimed to <br> persuade its victims to doubt thier abilities and capabilites while <br> also becoming subdued by the abuser.</h3></p>

<h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
<p><h3>Challenge Child Abuse is trying to end and prevent child abuse. We have created a device called "The Wristband" that will allow <br> children to communicate with someone from our headquarters. The wristband has two buttons. When the wristband <br> turns on it will ask you how you are feeling today. Then you can respond by pressing button a for a smiley face<br> or button b for a frowny face. If you have an emergency you press a then b then both at the same time to send an emergency <br> call to headquarters. Finally headquarters will respond by telling you help is on the way.</h3></p>
